# Super Copy (RIP, 2004-2007)
 [deprecated] Better UI for Windows Server 2003 copy, with simulation and retry

Super Copy provides a very robust way to copy files in Windows. Super Copy does not prompt you for more information once the copy has started; all options are specified beforehand. This is simply a lightweight interface for XCOPY, and will not negatively affect your system's performance. Read about why I wrote SuperCopy.

### Features
"Calculate Results" mode allows you to see what files will be affected.
"Open" and "Save" allow you to import and export automatically generated batch files
Resume ability - recover from a power failure without having to restart the process.
Log summaries
Handles large amounts of data (over 100GB per transfer)
Ignores locked files
Copies hidden/system files
Recovers from temporary network disconnects
Technology
HTML Application (.hta file)
Dependent only upon IE and XCOPY. No other dependencies.
Dos script generation (.bat format) for scheduling backups or postponing transfers.
The installer uses NSIS, which is an absolutely awesome setup scripting language.

You can help
This product is still growing. Please pass on all of its obvious shortcomings, as well as the not-so-obvious ones. You can either use the forum, or e-mail me.
Please realize that your feedback is very important, as it will determine the future direction of this project. Let me know if I am making it too complex in some areas, or over-simplifying in others.
This project is by nature Open Source, as it is written in an interpreted language. Changes should be easy to make, so feel free. Of course, I would be ecstatic to get a copy.
