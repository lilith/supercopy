<div class="wikidoc"><h1>Super Copy</h1>Super Copy provides a very robust way to copy files in Windows. Super Copy does not prompt you for more information once the copy has started; all options are specified beforehand. This is simply a lightweight interface for XCOPY, and will not negatively affect your system&#39;s performance. Read about <a href="http://quickkeydotnet.sourceforge.net/filetransfer.html">why I wrote SuperCopy</a>.<br /><br />Check out my blog and other utilities at <a href="http://nathanaeljones.com/">nathanaeljones.com</a>!<br />
